            Its very strange to think, just two years ago, We was just friends. Meeting you through unaceadmy was a moment of fate that I‚Äôll always be grateful for.

At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure how would u even accept me as i am not even your feet at the beauty standards but you proved me wrong that the real love is done by heart not

by the beauty or face and thats what i learnt from you ü•∫ü•∫üíû THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR BEING SO GOOD HUMAN BEING HAVING GOLDEN HEART FR. in the starting i also not able

to talk properly because inside my heart it craves to say u baby but it is forced to say bestie but yeah after getting 3 times rejected üëÄüëÄ I‚Äôve realized something 

truly special and that moment i knew that im only hers You‚Äôre absolutely amazing. üíñ It was very long way that we have already marked I genuinely won when I got YOU

THANKYOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR CHOOSING ME I CANT IMAGINE MY LIFE WITHOUT YOU
 I LOVE YOU THE MOST üíï
