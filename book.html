          <p>
            Its very strange to think, just two years ago, We was just friends. Meeting you through unaceadmy was a moment of fate that I’ll always be grateful for.

At first, I wasn’t sure how would u even accept me as i am not even your feet at the beauty standards but you proved me wrong that the real love is done by heart not

by the beauty or face and thats what i learnt from you 🥺🥺💞 THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR BEING SO GOOD HUMAN BEING HAVING GOLDEN HEART FR. in the starting i also not able

to talk properly because inside my heart it craves to say u baby but it is forced to say bestie but yeah after getting 3 times rejected 👀👀 I’ve realized something 

truly special and that moment i knew that im only hers You’re absolutely amazing. 💖 It was very long way that we have already marked I genuinely won when I got YOU

THANKYOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR CHOOSING ME I CANT IMAGINE MY LIFE WITHOUT YOU
 I LOVE YOU THE MOST 💕

            Sometimes, I find myself wishing I could meet you in person, just to see the smile that brightens my day and hear the voice that makes everything feel lighter. Maybe it’s a long shot, but the thought still lingers.

            Even though we’ve only known each other for a short time, I hope you won’t forget me. Our moments, our conversations—they mean more to me than you might realize.
            
            No matter what happens, I truly wish you a life filled with happiness, peace, and everything you deserve. 💕
            
            You are someone special, and I hope life gives you endless reasons to smile. No matter where we go from here, I’ll always be grateful for the time we’ve shared. And if fate ever allows, maybe one day our paths will cross for real. ✨

            My time is yours whenever you need it.
            
            Life can be unpredictable, but I hope you never feel alone. Whether it’s a good day or a tough one, I’ll always be here to cheer you on, to remind you how amazing you are.
            
            You deserve nothing but happiness, and if I can be a small part of that, I’d be honored. No matter where life takes us, just know that you’ll always have someone who cares—someone who truly believes in you. 💕
